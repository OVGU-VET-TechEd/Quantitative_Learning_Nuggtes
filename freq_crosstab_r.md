## What are Frequency and Cross Tables?

{{1}}
**Frequency Tables** (also called frequency distributions) show how often each value or category appears in your dataset. They answer: *"How many observations fall into each category?"*

{{2}}
**Cross Tables** (also called contingency tables or crosstabs) display the relationship between two or more categorical variables. They answer: *"How are categories of one variable distributed across categories of another?"*

{{3}}
> **Important:** Before working with frequency and cross tables, you should:
> - Have completed the **"Descriptive Statistics"** learning nugget
> - Understand your variable types (nominal, ordinal)
> - Check data quality and missing values

## 🔧 Setting Up Your R Environment

{{1}}
### Step 1: Load Required Packages

```r
# Install packages (only needed once)
install.packages("gmodels")
install.packages("descr")
install.packages("janitor")

# Load packages (needed every session)
library(gmodels)   # For CrossTable function
library(descr)     # For crosstab function
library(janitor)   # For tabyl function
```

{{2}}
### Step 2: Load Your Data

```r
# Option 1: Using built-in dataset (for practice)
data(mtcars)
df <- mtcars

# Convert numeric to factors for categorical analysis
df$cyl <- factor(df$cyl, levels = c(4, 6, 8),
                 labels = c("4 cyl", "6 cyl", "8 cyl"))
df$am <- factor(df$am, levels = c(0, 1),
                labels = c("Automatic", "Manual"))
df$vs <- factor(df$vs, levels = c(0, 1),
                labels = c("V-shaped", "Straight"))

# Option 2: Load your own CSV file
# df <- read.csv("your_data.csv")

# Check structure
str(df)
```

## 📈 Frequency Tables for Single Variables

{{1}}
### Absolute Frequencies

Absolute frequency shows the count of observations in each category.

```r
# Simple frequency table
table(df$cyl)

# Store in object
freq_cyl <- table(df$cyl)
freq_cyl

# More detailed output
summary(df$cyl)
```

**Example Output:**
```
4 cyl  6 cyl  8 cyl 
   11      7     14
```

{{2}}
**When to use absolute frequencies:**
- ✅ When you need exact counts
- ✅ Nominal or ordinal categorical data
- ✅ To see sample sizes per category
- ✅ Before calculating proportions or percentages
- ✅ Quality control and data validation

{{3}}
### Relative Frequencies (Proportions)

Relative frequency shows the proportion of observations in each category (0 to 1).

```r
# Calculate relative frequencies
prop.table(table(df$cyl))

# With more decimal places
round(prop.table(table(df$cyl)), 3)

# Store in object
rel_freq_cyl <- prop.table(table(df$cyl))
rel_freq_cyl
```

**Example Output:**
```
  4 cyl   6 cyl   8 cyl 
  0.344   0.219   0.438
```

{{4}}
**When to use relative frequencies:**
- ✅ Comparing distributions across different sample sizes
- ✅ When proportions are more meaningful than counts
- ✅ Statistical calculations (probabilities)
- ✅ Academic reporting (often preferred)

{{5}}
### Percentages

Percentages show the proportion multiplied by 100.

```r
# Calculate percentages
prop.table(table(df$cyl)) * 100

# Rounded to 2 decimal places
round(prop.table(table(df$cyl)) * 100, 2)

# Store in object
perc_cyl <- round(prop.table(table(df$cyl)) * 100, 2)
perc_cyl
```

**Example Output:**
```
4 cyl  6 cyl  8 cyl 
34.38  21.88  43.75
```

{{6}}
**When to use percentages:**
- ✅ General audience or non-technical reports
- ✅ Easier interpretation than proportions
- ✅ Visual presentations (charts, infographics)
- ✅ Business reports and dashboards

{{7}}
### Comprehensive Frequency Table

Combine all information in one table:

```r
# Create comprehensive frequency table
freq_table <- data.frame(
  Category = names(table(df$cyl)),
  Frequency = as.vector(table(df$cyl)),
  Relative = round(as.vector(prop.table(table(df$cyl))), 3),
  Percentage = round(as.vector(prop.table(table(df$cyl))) * 100, 2),
  Cumulative_Freq = cumsum(as.vector(table(df$cyl))),
  Cumulative_Perc = round(cumsum(as.vector(prop.table(table(df$cyl)))) * 100, 2)
)

freq_table
```

**Example Output:**
```
  Category  Frequency  Relative  Percentage  Cumulative_Freq  Cumulative_Perc
1   4 cyl         11     0.344       34.38               11            34.38
2   6 cyl          7     0.219       21.88               18            56.25
3   8 cyl         14     0.438       43.75               32           100.00
```

{{8}}
**Interpreting Comprehensive Tables:**
- **Frequency:** Raw counts
- **Relative:** Proportion (sum = 1.0)
- **Percentage:** Proportion × 100 (sum = 100%)
- **Cumulative Frequency:** Running total of counts
- **Cumulative Percentage:** Running total of percentages (useful for ordinal data)

## 🔀 Cross Tables (Contingency Tables)

{{1}}
### Basic Cross Table (2×2 and Beyond)

Cross tables show the relationship between two categorical variables.

```r
# Simple cross table: cylinders by transmission
table(df$cyl, df$am)

# With row and column names
crosstab <- table(df$cyl, df$am)
crosstab

# Add margins (row and column totals)
addmargins(crosstab)
```

**Example Output (without margins):**
```
        Automatic  Manual
4 cyl           3       8
6 cyl           4       3
8 cyl          12       2
```

**Example Output (with margins):**
```
        Automatic  Manual  Sum
4 cyl           3       8   11
6 cyl           4       3    7
8 cyl          12       2   14
Sum            19      13   32
```

{{2}}
**When to use cross tables:**
- ✅ Examining relationship between two categorical variables
- ✅ Before conducting Chi-square test
- ✅ Comparing group distributions
- ✅ Survey data analysis
- ✅ Exploring associations between factors

{{3}}
### Cross Table with Row Percentages

Show how categories of the **column variable** are distributed within each **row**.

```r
# Row percentages
prop.table(table(df$cyl, df$am), margin = 1) * 100

# Rounded
round(prop.table(table(df$cyl, df$am), margin = 1) * 100, 2)

# Example interpretation:
# "Of cars with 4 cylinders, X% are manual and Y% are automatic"
```

**Example Output:**
```
        Automatic  Manual
4 cyl       27.27   72.73     (each row sums to 100%)
6 cyl       57.14   42.86
8 cyl       85.71   14.29
```

**Reading this table:**
- Of 4-cylinder cars, 27.27% are automatic and 72.73% are manual
- Of 6-cylinder cars, 57.14% are automatic and 42.86% are manual
- Of 8-cylinder cars, 85.71% are automatic and 14.29% are manual

{{4}}
**When to use row percentages:**
- ✅ When the **row variable** is your grouping variable (independent variable)
- ✅ To compare how the column variable is distributed across row categories
- ✅ Example: "How does transmission type vary by cylinder count?"
- ✅ Reading: "Of [row category], X% are [column category]"

{{5}}
### Cross Table with Column Percentages

Show how categories of the **row variable** are distributed within each **column**.

```r
# Column percentages
prop.table(table(df$cyl, df$am), margin = 2) * 100

# Rounded
round(prop.table(table(df$cyl, df$am), margin = 2) * 100, 2)

# Example interpretation:
# "Of manual cars, X% have 4 cylinders, Y% have 6 cylinders, Z% have 8 cylinders"
```

**Example Output:**
```
        Automatic  Manual
4 cyl       15.79   61.54     (each column sums to 100%)
6 cyl       21.05   23.08
8 cyl       63.16   15.38
```

**Reading this table:**
- Of automatic cars, 15.79% have 4 cylinders, 21.05% have 6 cylinders, 63.16% have 8 cylinders
- Of manual cars, 61.54% have 4 cylinders, 23.08% have 6 cylinders, 15.38% have 8 cylinders

{{6}}
**When to use column percentages:**
- ✅ When the **column variable** is your grouping variable (independent variable)
- ✅ To compare how the row variable is distributed across column categories
- ✅ Example: "How does cylinder count vary by transmission type?"
- ✅ Reading: "Of [column category], X% are [row category]"

{{7}}
### Cross Table with Total Percentages

Show each cell as a percentage of the **grand total**.

```r
# Total percentages (of all observations)
prop.table(table(df$cyl, df$am)) * 100

# Rounded
round(prop.table(table(df$cyl, df$am)) * 100, 2)

# Example interpretation:
# "X% of all cars are 4-cylinder manuals"
```

**Example Output:**
```
        Automatic  Manual
4 cyl        9.38   25.00     (entire table sums to 100%)
6 cyl       12.50    9.38
8 cyl       37.50    6.25
```

**Reading this table:**
- 9.38% of all cars are 4-cylinder automatic
- 25.00% of all cars are 4-cylinder manual
- 37.50% of all cars are 8-cylinder automatic
- Most common combination: 8-cylinder automatic (37.50%)

{{8}}
**When to use total percentages:**
- ✅ To see the overall distribution across both variables
- ✅ When both variables are equally important
- ✅ To identify the most common combinations
- ✅ Marketing segmentation analysis

## 🎯 Decision Guide: Which Percentage to Use?

{{1}}
### Quick Reference

| Research Question | Use This | Margin | Example |
|:------------------|:---------|:-------|:--------|
| "How does Y vary by X?" | Row % | margin = 1 | "How does transmission vary by cylinder count?" |
| "How does X vary by Y?" | Column % | margin = 2 | "How does cylinder count vary by transmission?" |
| "What's the overall distribution?" | Total % | No margin | "What % of all cars are 4-cyl manual?" |
| "Which combination is most common?" | Total % | No margin | "What's the most common cyl-transmission combo?" |

{{2}}
### Critical Rule

> **The percentages should add up to 100% in the direction you're analyzing:**
> - Row percentages: Each **row** sums to 100%
> - Column percentages: Each **column** sums to 100%
> - Total percentages: The **entire table** sums to 100%

{{3}}
### Visual Decision Tree

```ascii
        What is your independent variable?

        ____________|____________
       |                         |
   Row Variable            Column Variable
       |                         |
   Use ROW %               Use COLUMN %
   (margin = 1)            (margin = 2)
       
   
   No clear independent variable?
            |
        Use TOTAL %
```

## 📝 Interpreting Cross Tables

{{1}}
### What to Look For

When analyzing cross tables, examine:

1. **Marginal distributions:** Row and column totals
2. **Cell frequencies:** Are any cells very small (n < 5)?
3. **Patterns:** Do percentages differ across categories?
4. **Expected vs. observed:** Do distributions look independent?

{{2}}
### Example Interpretation

```r
# Create example table
CrossTable(df$cyl, df$am,
           prop.r = TRUE,
           prop.c = FALSE,
           prop.t = FALSE,
           prop.chisq = FALSE,
           chisq = FALSE)
```

**Example Output (simplified):**
```
   Cell Contents
|-------------------------|
|                       N |
|           N / Row Total |
|-------------------------|

             | df$am 
      df$cyl | Automatic |    Manual | Row Total | 
-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
      4 cyl  |         3 |         8 |        11 | 
             |     0.273 |     0.727 |           | 
-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
      6 cyl  |         4 |         3 |         7 | 
             |     0.571 |     0.429 |           | 
-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
      8 cyl  |        12 |         2 |        14 | 
             |     0.857 |     0.143 |           | 
-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
Column Total |        19 |        13 |        32 | 
-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
```

**Sample interpretation:**
> "A cross tabulation of cylinder count and transmission type shows that 4-cylinder cars are predominantly manual (72.7%, n = 8 of 11), while 8-cylinder cars are predominantly automatic (85.7%, n = 12 of 14). Six-cylinder cars show a more balanced distribution (57.1% automatic, n = 4; 42.9% manual, n = 3)."

{{3}}
### Red Flags in Cross Tables

- ⚠️ **Small cell counts:** Cells with n < 5 (problematic for Chi-square test)
- ⚠️ **Empty cells:** Categories with zero observations
- ⚠️ **Unbalanced design:** Very different group sizes
- ⚠️ **Too many categories:** Makes interpretation difficult

```r
# Simple bar chart
barplot(table(df$cyl),
        main = "Distribution of Cylinder Counts",
        xlab = "Number of Cylinders",
        ylab = "Frequency",
        col = "lightblue",
        border = "black")

# Horizontal bar chart
barplot(table(df$cyl), horiz = TRUE,

## 🎯 Common Mistakes to Avoid

{{1}}
### Mistake 1: Wrong Percentage Direction

```r
# WRONG: Using column % when you should use row %
# If cylinders is your grouping variable, use row %
prop.table(table(df$cyl, df$am), margin = 2)  # Wrong!

# CORRECT:
prop.table(table(df$cyl, df$am), margin = 1)  # Right!
```

{{2}}
### Mistake 2: Not Checking for Missing Values

```r
# WRONG: Ignoring NAs
table(df$variable_with_na)

# CORRECT: Include NAs or handle explicitly
table(df$variable_with_na, useNA = "always")  # Shows NAs
table(df$variable_with_na, useNA = "ifany")   # Shows NAs if present
```

{{3}}
### Mistake 3: Too Many Decimal Places

```r
# WRONG: Excessive precision
prop.table(table(df$cyl)) * 100
# Result: 34.37500 34.37500 31.25000

# CORRECT: Round appropriately
round(prop.table(table(df$cyl)) * 100, 1)
# Result: 34.4 34.4 31.2
```

{{4}}
### Mistake 4: Forgetting Totals

```r
# WRONG: No context for interpretation
table(df$cyl, df$am)

# CORRECT: Include margins
addmargins(table(df$cyl, df$am))
```

## 📋 Reporting Guidelines

{{1}}
### For Frequency Tables

> "Of the 32 vehicles analyzed, 11 (34.4%) had 4 cylinders, 7 (21.9%) had 6 cylinders, and 14 (43.8%) had 8 cylinders."

{{2}}
### For Cross Tables

> "A cross-tabulation of cylinder count and transmission type revealed that manual transmissions were more common among 4-cylinder vehicles (9 of 11, 81.8%), while automatic transmissions dominated 8-cylinder vehicles (12 of 14, 85.7%)."

{{3}}
### APA Style Table Example

```
Table 1
Frequency and Percentage of Vehicles by Cylinder Count

Cylinders    n     %
--------------------------
4           11   34.4
6            7   21.9
8           14   43.8
--------------------------
Total       32  100.0
```
